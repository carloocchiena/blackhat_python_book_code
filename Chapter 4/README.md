## Notes for the reader

Scapy for Python3 is commonly found under Kamene libs https://kamene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html<br>
The cv2 module is now replaced by open-cv python. See: <br>
- https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
- https://docs.opencv.org/master/

Another source cited in the book is https://fideloper.com/facial-detection; 
<br>here, you can also download the data for the training set: https://eclecti.cc/files/2008/03/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

if you're not familiar with open-cv module, this part will result quite bumpy (also, the book goes thru this section without much explanation)
