# Code and exercises from the book "Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters" 
Examples and exercises from the book "Black Hat Python" by Justin Seitz.

### About the book
The book is something of a milestone for the pentesting world in Python.
Although it was published relatively recently (2014), it is all written in Python 2.7.

You can find the book on <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Black-Hat-Python-Programming-Pentesters-ebook/dp/B00QL616DW#customerReviews">Amazon</a>.

While the official book page is on<a href="https://nostarch.com/black-hat-python2E#updates">No Starch Press</a> website.

Apparently you should be able to download the book's source code from there, but the link atm is not working.
 
### Reason for this repo
Deliberately, as expressed by the author, the scripts are written raw & dirty to simulate the " as long as it works" approach during a hack.
However, this sometimes leads to code that is not very understandable, and not very efficient.

I created this repository with the intent to collect all the scripts in the book, ported to Python 3, and, where I can, optimizing them (syntax, forms, error catching, unsupported libraries).

I am starring this awesome repo from EONRaider, that I might use in the case I'll be getting stuck in later sections of the books. Seems fair to add this source as a source of inspiration: <a href="https://github.com/EONRaider/blackhat-python3">EON RIDER Repo</a>
