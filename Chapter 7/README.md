### Notes for the readers

This chapter is about a trojan interacting with our Github repo for updates.<br>

The book suggest to create a folder structure within a test repository. I created this as well in this section, following along book instructions.<br>
Usual amount of optimization and cleaning was needed. The author seems to rush along every chapter leaving a lot of gaps here and there.<br>

For this chapter in particular I had a confrontation with EON Raider repository (https://github.com/EONRaider/blackhat-python3) to double check I got to a reasonable\correct routine.<br>

This chapter is also dedicated to show some git commands run from shell; this part has not been reproduced (obviously) here. <br>

The imp library the author is using is officially deprecated. You can go with importlib or even types. <br> 
See https://docs.python.org/3/library/imp.html <br>
The Github wrapper could be found here https://github.com/copitux/python-github3
