### Notes for the reader
- The bhservice folder contains material provided by the book for testing purpose. At the moment of writing the link provided by the author was not working but I managed to find it online.
- `file_monitor.py` was, accordingly to book notes, inspired by http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i/watch_directory_for_changes.html
