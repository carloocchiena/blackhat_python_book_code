## Note for the reader

The test_rsa.key and the rforward.py files are mentioned from the author on chapter two, but are not given in the context of the book.
You have actually to download them from https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/tree/main/demos 

I included them here just for convenience since, anyway, you need to have them locally to run the scripts in this part of the book.
