### Notes for the reader

- The cryptography library used in the book (`pycrypto`) is deprecated. I used `pycryptodome` instead (further readings: https://blog.sqreen.com/stop-using-pycrypto-use-pycryptodome/)
<br><br>
- `mitb.py` stands for "Man-in-the-Browser" :) and yes, the book built it for Internet Explorer. <br> Since it doesn't make sense to me to invest time to reproduce a test case on IE, I left out the testing of this part, evaluating only the correctness of the code by debugging runs in my IDE.
